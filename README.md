# reachingforyieldVAR

This project aims to examine the 'Reaching for Yield' hypothesis using time series econometric methods. 

The specific question we intend to examine follows: Does the ‘reaching for yield’ hypothesis hold in observed data, such that decreases in interest rates, as measured by the Federal Funds Rate (FFR), lead households and nonprofits serving households to increase investments in risky assets?
