# reachingforyieldVAR

This project aims to examine the 'Reaching for Yield' hypothesis using time series econometric methods. 

The specific question we intend to examine follows: Does the ‘reaching for yield’ hypothesis hold in observed data, such that decreases in interest rates, as measured by the 3-Month Treasury Yield, lead households and nonprofits serving households to increase investments in risky assets, with individual investor sentiment and consumer confidence serving as an indicator of this risk-taking behavior?
